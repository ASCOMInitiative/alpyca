# AlpycaClient
Python client interface for [ASCOM Alpaca](https://ascom-standards.org/Developer/Alpaca.htm)

Derived and modernized from [Ethan/Chappel/Alpyca](https://github.com/EthanChappel/Alpyca). Interfaces and member casing corrected, refactored to class per module, additonal classes added, discovery, return of native types rather than strings, and more. 

Much work left to be completed, and this yet to be written!
