# alpaca-client

## Python 3.6+ client interface for all [ASCOM Alpaca](https://ascom-standards.org/Developer/Alpaca.htm) universal interfaces.

Inspired by [EthanChappel/Alpyca](https://github.com/EthanChappel/Alpyca). When this releases as **alpyca-client** Ethan's original **alpyca** package on PyPi will redirect to this client package.

**Progress:** Interfaces and member casing corrected, refactored to class per module, return of native types, and more. All remaining ASCOM device classes added and implemented, management interface and discovery added and implemented.

_[10-April-2022]_ Just wrapping up the PyTest unit tests. Still remining is a total review of the docstrings for input to Sphinx as well as Intellisense popup help, production of documentation, and Poetry-created PyPi package.

Much work left to be completed, and this yet to be written!
