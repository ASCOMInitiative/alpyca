* Came a long way, restructured. Decided to use Poetry for packaging and publishing. Learned that you need to use virtualenv to create your venvs if you want to activate in a shell and pip from there.

    ===================================================================
    MORAL: CREATE VENVS WITH VIRTUALENV THEN ADD TO THE VS2019 PROJECT. Then a TCC shell can pip install to the venv.
    ===================================================================

* Review for Poetry:
  Install & Config:
    1. Install poetry globally with the new install-poetry.py per https://python-poetry.org/docs/master/#installation not
       in a virtual environment! NOTE! I had to download the .py script and run locally. SSL problems (likely my W7 system)
    2. Configure not to do anything with venvs, leave that to VS2019. poetry configure virtualenvs.create = false
    3. Add the pw PyPi as a named package repo: poetry config repositories.testpypi https://test.pypi.org/legacy/
    4. Tell Poetry to use token auth with this: poetry config pypi-token.testpypi <token, be sure it's the test one!>
  0. Make the VS project and add a virgin venv.
  1. Open shell and cd to root of project (with a virgin venv!!), then enter the venv (!!) env\Scripts\Activate.bat
  2. (env) > poetry init to make the pyproject.toml
  3. In pyproject.toml fill in the other stuff and most importantly the 'packages = [ {include="src/package"} ]' so it knows
     where your package stuff is!. See https://python-poetry.org/docs/pyproject/. Supply a URL to the GitHub suppore forum.
  4. poetry add 'xxx' for each dependency, this makes/updates the .lock and also [tool.poetry.dependencies] section.
  5. poetry install -- This installs the dependencies into the project. AT THIS POINT YOU CAN RUN TESTS.
  6. poetry build ... the 'stuff' will be in dist ready to publish
  7. poetry publish -r testpypi to publish to testpypi.
  8. Try to install the new package (tenv) > pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ rbd-example-rdenny==0.0.3

30-Mar-2022
-----------
* Doing AlpacaClient now:
  + Re-do the pyproject.toml for poetry, no more build stuff needed
  + Remove old venv
  + Create new one with virtualenv so pip works in activated shell. This is now just basic seeded.
  + Use poetry to add dependencies (see Device.py). Note that the ones that aren't red squiggled are part of Python.
         FAIL SPECTACULARLY - the C:\Users\Robert B. Denny\AppData\Local\pypoetry\Cache had missing artifacts. I just deleted the
         whole thing.
      poetry add requests - ok
      poetry add netifaces -ok
      poetry install "No dependencies to install or update"  (there are no extra development dependencies)

31-Mar-2022
-----------
* Finally, after gardening my messy Python installations, time to set up to do PyTest based unit testing.
  This required some reorganizing of the project layout.
* Use Poetry to install the PyTest package so it knows about it at the time the package is built later.
  This puts those dependencies into the pyproject.toml under [tool.poetry.dev-dependencies].
* DAMN ! My gardening ruined virtenv and poetry.
  + pip install virtenv -> OK runs in shell now
  + python install.python-poetry.py - damn it's already there.
  + python install.python-poetry.py --uninstall -> OK
  + python install.python-poetry.py -> OK but NO ACCESS FROM SHELL
    > cd %APPDATA%\pypoetry
    > venv\Scripts\activate.bat
    (venv) > poetry OK
  + so this is just the linkage that's broken. Oh  yeah, I need to put poetry bin into my path..... And, sure enough
    it appears that I dropped the C:\Users\Robert B. Denny\AppData\Roaming\pypoetry\venv\Scripts\poetry.exe from PATH or it changed after my gardening and reinstallation. Whatever. Add  C:\Users\Robert B. Denny\AppData\Roaming\pypoetry\venv\Scripts\poetry.exe to PATH.
* Back to installing PyTest.
  + poetry add --dev pytest, put pytest = "^7.1.1" into the pyproject.toml file. > OK
  + poetry install -- OOPS, added pytest to the .LOCK.
  * revert the .lock
  + poetry install --no-dev > OK (no changes to lock)
  + (venv) > pytest -> OK
* Time to try a test.
  + Create PyTest\test_safetymonitor.py
  + Enter the venv, cd to PyTest, run pytest:
    (venv) > cd PyTest
    (venv) > pytest
================================================= test session starts =================================================

    -> OK!!!
* Finally set up VS2019 to use PyTest.
  + In the Solution Explorer right-click project, Propeties... then in that window on the left Test. Select PyTest.
  + Now in the Test menu select Test Explorer and get familiar. COOL!!
  + Run the Not Run test (this one). It ran fine!
  + Set the IsSafe to false to force a failure. Run it. then expand the Test Explorer to see theTest Detail Summary.
  + >>> LOOKING GOOD <<<<  (no need for the shell any more, I am such a VS2019 cripple!)
  + -- Set the Alpaca CLass files to Read Only for  now --
* Need settings from OmniSimulator: With process-monitor I found the OmniSim settings at C:\Users\Robert B. Denny\.ASCOM\Alpaca\ASCOM-Alpaca-Simulator in subfolders DeviceName\v1\Instance-0.xml. Now to find out how to rad settings from that XML file with Python. FUN!
  + See ReadOmniSimSettings.py for how to get the settings. Now to turn them into a dictionary.
* OY!! Earlier I accidentally did a global ssearach/replace on \ to / and it ripped through the modules in venv!!! I had to re-create it. I REMEMBERED TO USE VIRTENV in the SHELL.

01-Apr-2022
-----------
* I noticed the Test menu items were dimmed out... for a while ?!?!? While looking for the solution they came back? Anyway, I found that the right way for PyTest to be used is via a PyTest.ini file, see https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/reference/reference.html#ini-options-ref but it seems that the pyproject.toml file is sufficient. https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/reference/customize.html#config-file-formats For testing a new [tool.pytest.ini_options] section is needed. I wonder if VS2019 uses it? Well I fill in the testpaths but it still took quite a while to light the menu. Maybe opening the test explorer did it. No.
* I noticed that it is very quiet for successful tests. It doesn't appear to look at the [tool.pytest.ini_options] at all.
* ==== LESSON: SAVE SETTINGS ON OMNI SIM DEVICES TO POPULATE THE INI FILES ====
*  While trying to use a class to share one reading of the device's settings, I discovered that __init__() stops PyTest from seeing the module as a test module. I suspect this needs to be a fixture :-( Actually it seems like a fixture is the ticket for reading the device's settings as well as doing the connect as part of setup, and disconnect as part ofthe teardown.
* Breakthrough, move all the setup and teardown into fixtures in conftest.py which is used by PyTest. No more simconf. The code is independent of the device name. It is able to create the device class from the class name as a string, and then return a handle to a connected device. The connection happens at module scope, remains through all tests of that device, then gets torn down at the end. How cool is that?

04-May-2022
-----------
* Much  progress on tests, see Git logs. Imagebytes is now working for ImageArray, more or less.
* Cloned project into VSCOde on the Raspberry Pi. Ran tests, corrected Camera.py and pushed. Pulled on VS2019/Win, all well.

05-Apr-2022
-----------
* Back on VS2019, goal is to get image data into a list of lists so numpy can make an 'nimage'.

07-Apr-2022
-----------
* Loads of water under the bridge. I have Camera finisned including ImageBytes support. WooHoo!
* Install numpy and astropy for testing.
* WOOHOO producing FITS for Monochrome and bayer. 3-D color not yet.

09-Apr-2022
-----------
* WOOHOO All unit tests completed and all but one runs OK. THe pulse guiding in the OmniSim seems weird.
* What a long road!!!

10-Apr-2022
-----------
* Update conftest.py on RPi per Daniel so it finds OmniSim settings on Linux. The tests appear in the tests pane after fixing errors ha ha,
* Poetry is installed on the RPi.
* Tests all run on RPi now, and also on Windows.
* Working with autodocstring. Making a custom template for alpyca to be stored at C:\Users\Robert B. Denny\.vscode\extensions\njpwerner.autodocstring-0.6.1\local\alpyca
* Install sphinx 4.5.0 (Python3) into the global packages for Python 3.7.
* Install Autodocstring into VSCode. Per its instructions crate alpaca.mustache as custom template, the 'live' copy is at
  C:\Users\Robert B. Denny\.vscode\extensions\njpwerner.autodocstring-0.6.1\local\alpaca.mustache.
* Install Napoleon for using Sphinx to build with Google-like docstrings (the sphinx stuff sucks)
  https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/napoleon.html
* Run the sphinx-quickstart in the AlpycaClient folder per https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/quickstart.html . I figured out to create a new doc folder at peer with the alpaca packge folder and tell quickstart to put stuff into doc, with the output going into _build. Note that .gitignore already had doc/_build so that's what gave me the idea.
* NOTE LOOK AT THIS FOR NAPOLEON DOCSTRING https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/napoleon.html
* Failed a few times...

-- TOMORROW --

11-Apr-2022
-----------
* Make a doc_test folder and work through this tutorial. I created a simple class and a file of exceptions... more later.
  === NOTE === I installed Sphinx globally not in the venv. So use a shell that's not tied to the venv.
* Ran sphinx-quickstart, edited conf.py, added to basically empty index.rst per tutorial
* Make html ... but not using rinoh to maybe 'automodule' in the .rst is not supported:
    D:\dev\astro\ASCOM Alpaca\doc_test\docs\source\index.rst:15: ERROR: Unknown directive type "automodule".
    .. automodule:: api.sample
* What I got out of this was to create a docs folder within which run sphinx-quickstart, but that won't find anything. See sphinx-apidoc below.
* sphinx-quickstart -- "Root" means documentation root so take default .
* In docs/source/conf.py
    import os
    import sys
    sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath('..\\..\\api'))  # This has to be from here (doc/source)
    extensions = [
            'sphinx.ext.autodoc',
            'sphinx.ext.autosummary',
            'sphinx.ext.napoleon'
    ]
* Much wrestling. The path is os.path.abspath('..\\..\\api') to find the api .py files
* I found sphinx-apidoc which generates starter rst files in source. Run when in the docs folder.
    > sphinx-apidoc -f -o source ..\api
    Creating file source\device.rst.
    Creating file source\exceptions.rst.
    Creating file source\modules.rst.
  + For now let's get going with the basic index.rst and have it generate some reasonable doc. Remove these and go back to index.rst.
  + Note that if a specifically called autoexception (or autoclass) has no docstring you will get an error during build that AttributeError: module 'exceptions' has no attribute 'xxxexception'
  + Making progress in my test. The Dome class is good, the SHutterState enum not....
  + Need https://enum-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/autoenum.html to add .. autoenum::
    1. pip install enum-tools[sphinx] ** HOLY HELL **
    2. Add enum_tools.autoenum to conf.py extensions
    3. Example
        .. module:: dome
        .. autoclass:: Dome
            :members:
        .. autoenum:: ShutterState
            :members:
    When you do this, Sphinx finds references to the enum and makes links!!! WOOHOO!!!
  + Changed Enum types to IntEnum and Sphinx finds the intrisic 'int' type and documents it. I DID THIS IN THE REAL SOURCES TOO.
  + The instances in  method docs of exceptions are also linked!!! WOOHOO!!!
  + Oh yeah I had to chage the package from 'api' to 'alpaca' for the imports. THIS WILL CHANGE IN THE REAL THING.
  + NOW!! LOOK! https://enum-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_modules/enum_tools/demo.html#People See my sample
    import enum_tools shows error but @enum_tools.documentation.document_enum on ShutterState produces the docs with explanatory text!!
  + In all cases make html from docs folder is the make process
  + The command
    .. module:: covercalibrator
    .. autoclass:: CoverCalibrator
        :members:
        :inherited-members: Device
    does not include all of the members of Device within the doc of (e.g.) CoverCalibrator
12-Apr-2022
-----------
* Switch gears to look and feel. Alabaster theme sucks. We have the official
    https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/theming.html
  as well as the unofficial
    https://sphinx-themes.org/  <-- THIS IS AWESOME
* Install new themes (some n/g and removed)
  pip install sphinx-rtd-theme  (ReadTheDocs, ok)
  pip install cloud-sptheme  (Finally decided on this one with adjustments in conf.py)

**** OK TIME TO START ON THE REAL THING ****
* Shell in AlpycaClient\docs > sphinx-apidoc --full -e --tocfile index -o source ..\alpaca
  + This didn't create separate build folcer but _build. I edited make.bat and Makefile, the moved them up to docs to make source and build folders peers like in the doc-test. You  run make html from the docs folder with source and build under.
*  Hooray, I resolved the "no alpaca module shit". Point Sphinx to the parent of 'alpaca' folder and it sees the __init__.py in that folder and sees it as a package.
* enum_tools has to be imported at run time, no way I'm including it and its many dependencies in the package.
  pip uninstall enum-tools[sphinx] in the main as well as the venv
  >> OOPS << It has to be in the main site-packages for autoenum in Sphinx.
14-Apr-2022
-----------
* Loads more work with Sphinx done. Learning fast now, finally, after loads of frustration
* AutoDocString template is in
  C:\Users\Robert B. Denny\.vscode\extensions\njpwerner.autodocstring-0.6.1\local\alpaca.mustache
  with a copy in hte AlpycaClient\docs folder.
* Learned a LOT about cross referencing including use of ~ to remove dotted names leaving last visible.

15-Apr-2022
-----------
* From https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39534718/how-to-create-a-pdf-out-of-sphinx-documentation-tool I found rinohtype

* BOOYAH!! I made a PDF this morning.
  Add the rinoh_documents info to docs/source/conf.py
* CoverCalibrator doc
* Dome doc
* Exceptions doc, then I realized Exceptions should not take a number except the two general ones.
* Re-do exception signatures, fix exception dispatchers in Camera and in Device.
* Switch from requests package to httpx https://www.python-httpx.org/
* Add second optional timeout parameter to _get() and _put() funcs in Device mainly for Telescope.FindHome(), which failed
  unit tests after switching to httpx.
* Add (w/Poetry) the HTTP/2 support so in the future people can try this out.
  --- Never mind, don't include this by default ---
* Fix Telescope unit test after adding timeout for HTTPX to _put() and _get() in Device class.

03-May-2022
-----------
* Loads of water under the bridge. Discovery was a big task, and is working great now. Working on the Sphinx docs and tests, adding the module headers via VSCode snippets.
* Removed refs to and go back to requests. Httpx doesn't work with IPv6, and I got a Dependabot alert on https for security vulnerability. Forget it.
* --- Time to return to Poetry, fun times ahead ---
* pyproject.toml is for BOTH Poetry and PyTest. Don't F with the PyTest stuff :-)
  1. How to adjust the dependencies... ente venv venv\Scripts\Activate.bat Using VSCode PowerSHell (venv)>
  2. (venv)> poetry check -> all set! (checks pyproject.toml)
  3. (venv)> poetry show -> WAY TOO MUCH!!! How to start over? Hide poetry.lock and try again
  4. Now barfs on PyTest in the dev-dependencies I had 7.1.1, pip shows 7.1.2, still barfs.
  5. Remove entire dev-dependencies section, now barfs on httpx
  6. Remove httpx manually.
  7. Now barfs on python-dateutil ^2.8.2 and it is there. Remove requests, netifaces, python-dateutil and maybe start adding back dependencies with poetry add.....
  8. OK, poetry show (with just Python ^3.7) completes showing no dependencies. We're going to add back and do the lock after that.
  9. Poetry add netifaces, requests it's making a new lock file.

 16. Looks OK, but the docs are not there. Yes they will be on ReadTheDocs, but I also want the PDF doc to be included. Build it.
 17. Looking good, link to the online html docs on ASCOM-Standards.org for now.
* TIME TO FINALIZE THE DOCS FOR THE ALPHA RELEASE.
* Massive upgrade and reorg. Looking good!!!

05-May-2022
-----------
* Working on Rinoh style for the doc. The PDF Rinoh docs aren't the key, it's the online ones... See the new template alpyca.rtt and stylesheet alpyca.rts, linked from the Rinoh stuff in conf.py. (Oct 2024, found online ones via python -m rinoh --docs, ha ha. https://www.mos6581.org/rinohtype/master/)
* Success! Restyled the fonts, colors of boxes. Cannot get "Notes" to take as "Note:" though but that's OK because I think the Note being colored will be too  garish. One thing was the indents on DriverException. I was surprised to find that Rinoh is really fussy, and looks for only one space indents on the exceptions, plus I think ending a sentence at the end of a line goofs up the flowing as well.
* Replace the DriverException text everywhere so it render nice in PDF.
  (I thought... it didn't work, reverted it all).

06-May-2022
-----------
* Cleanup work, write the "real" README (learning Markdown, making image assets online)
* To use poetry you MUST BE IN THE VENV!!
* (venv)> poetry build
  - Built alpaca-client-0.1.0.tar.gz
  - Building wheel
  - Built alpaca_client-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl
* OK, this looks good. Am I ready for PyPi? No let's do the test one first: See 30-March install 3 and 4 for poetry:
  1. (venv) > poetry config repositories.testpypi https://test.pypi.org/legacy/
  2. (venv) > poetry config pypi-token.testpypi ...whatever...
* Dry run them publish to Test-PyPi. **IDIOT** Wrong Name. alpaca-client not alpyca-client (DUH)
* Change the name in pyproject.toml, rebuild, upload. It's there!! I deleted old projects on TestPyPi.
* On Linux, create new project, and add a venv. MUST OPEN A PYTHON FILE TO ACTIVATE THE EXTENSION. Then pip -m venv .venv and VSCode will pop up the dialog asking if you want to use it as your environment. Cool. Ready to test the package.
* pip install alpyca-client ... it worked!!! I can run the sample program now. BOOYAH!!

12-May-2022
-----------
* Lots of work on making RST extract workable for ASCOM docs. Was
* Tried to build html docs on **RPi 1** and got a Sphinx error
    AttributeError: 'DynamicRinohDistribution' object has no attribute _normalized_name'
  which I miraculously fixed by applying that patch shown on 16-april, and then adding another
    @property
    def _normalized_name(self):
        return "whatthe****'
  THE SITE PACKAGES IS IN ~.local/lib/python3.9/site-packages
* I think I need to put 0.5.4 Rinoh in as I found that the above is fixed. Oh well, some day.

13-May-2022
-----------
* Big decision today, change alpyca-client to alpyca.
  - Rename repo to alpyca on GitHub. THey provide auto-redirect for safety but we do need to change our remotes on all of the dev systems (Pi and Windows)
  - Rename the project directories on local systems to 'alpyca'
  - git remote set-url origin https://github.com/BobDenny/alpyca.git
  - git remote set-url origin https://github.com/BobDenny/alpyca.git
  - Test with VSCode on Pi and Windows.
  - VS2019 Rename Solution but renaming pyproj loses the virtual environment....
    1. Edit solution Alpaca.sln
        Project("{888888A0-9F3D-457C-B088-3A5042F75D52}") = "Alpyca", "Alpyca.pyproj", "{A7A25108-7BAE-4CE4-8D13-1C1D81C6F2B4}"
    2. **GIT** Rename AlpycaClient.pyproj to Alpaca.pyproj. -- OK
  - VS2019 - Git repo etc offline. Tools > Options > Source Control > Plugin Selection > Git -- Now it all works.
* Published to TestPyPi -- API Key there, so
  - poetry publish -r testpypi (note the config setup on 06-May). Worked, but TestPyPi changed to 2.0.0.dev1

14-Jun-2022
-----------

        r.py')

        NOW WHAT?????
  -- Well try VSCode on Windows. Maybe THAT will work. How did VS2019 get ruined???
     Most pass, still having problems trying to "go to test" looking for AlpycaClient. I f-ed myself when I renamed
     the project I believe. Let's look with Windows Grep. HOLY SHIT!! THe whole .venv is a total MESS!!!
     Short story: Recreate the .venv with Poetry from scratch after updating all of the packages, then re-run
     the test suite.
**** RECREATE .VENV ****

1. Remove requirments.txt it is truly old.
2. Look at 30-March-22 Poetry startup
3. Confusion already reigns. I set virtual environments to false, yet
   > poetry config --list
	cache-dir = "C:\\Users\\Robert B. Denny\\AppData\\Local\\pypoetry\\Cache"
	experimental.new-installer = true
	installer.parallel = true  <======= WTF?????
	repositories.testpypi.url = "https://test.pypi.org/legacy/"
	virtualenvs.create = true
	virtualenvs.in-project = null
	virtualenvs.path = "{cache-dir}\\virtualenvs"  # C:\Users\Robert B. Denny\AppData\Local\pypoetry\Cache\virtualenvs
 4. The venv is a mess, we start over on this but with the existing pyproject.toml.
    a. Remove the existing venv from the project. Save the folder renamed as venv-old
    b. pip -m venv .venv (using 'venv' is the recommended way now not virtenv etc.)
    c. In VS, Add environment, Existing, Prefix path to the .venv folder. Looks good.
    d. Update pip and setuptools using VS2019
    e. Test in cmd shall .venv\Scripts\activate.bat -> (.venv) > pip list ---- OK!!
    f. We are now in a virgin venv.
 5. Delete the __pycache__ to hide old stuff too
 6. Empty poetry.lock
 7. Copy pyproject.toml
 8. Now with the shell in the virgin .venv, and looking at pyproject.toml do a "poetry add" for each dependency
    (.venv) > poetry add requests (already present)
    (.venv) > poetry add netifaces (already present)
    (.venv) > poetry add typing-extensions (already present)
    (.venv) > poetry add python-dateutil (already present)
    (.venv) > poetry add enum-tools (already present)
 9. PyTest goes in as a development dep, not to be included with package!
    (.venv) > poetry add --dev PyTest
 10. I removed the autopep8 dependency from the .toml. A mistake.
 11. Now to the install
    (.venv) > poetry install --no-dev
    BLOWOUT -- Remove poetry.lock
    (.venv) > poetry install --no-dev
    Starts normally but then GIANT BLOWOUT - and leaves a few things in the .venv the C:\Users\Robert B. Denny\AppData\Local\pypoetry\Cache had missing artifacts. I just deleted the whole thing.
    (.venv) > poetry install --no-dev
    Actually it needs PyTest and a few others.
    (.venv) > poetry install ... This puts PyTest into the .venv and lock. This is good.
 12. For the unit tests I need pytz, numpy, and astropy.io.fits also. Let's use poetry so others will need my versions or later.
    (.venv) > poetry add --dev pytz
    --- stand by for shit ---
    (.venv) > poetry add --dev numpy (FAIL on Python 3.7) - Look in PyPi and find 1.20.3 OK on Python >= 3.7
    (.venv) > poetry add --dev "numpy=1.20.3"  - Crazy Regsvr32 popups!!!
    (.venv) > poetry add --dev astropy  - Crazy Regsvr32 popups!!! then it also said no-go on 3.7 python so
    (.venv) > poetry add --dev "astropy=4.3.1"
    --- long story, **** it. Not going to install for dev with poetry. Will install with pip and be done --
    NET RESULT IN THE .TOML
	[tool.poetry.dependencies]
	python = "^3.7"
	requests = "^2.27.1"
	netifaces = "^0.11.0"
	typing-extensions = "^4.2.0"
	python-dateutil = "^2.8.2"
	enum-tools = "^0.9.0"

	[tool.poetry.dev-dependencies]
	pytest = "^7.1.2"
	pytz = "^2022.1"
 13. Install numpy and astropy with VS2019 package manager, Got numpy 1.21.6 with update t 1.22.4 showing but n/g for Python 3.7, and I got astropy 4.3.1 which is what I was trying to add! Well to hell with it. It affects only tests.
* TESTS RUN (including removal of bug workaround for OmniSim in test_telescope)
* Build the package
  (.venv) > poetry build
    - Built alpyca-2.0.0.dev1.tar.gz
    - Building wheel
    - Built alpyca-2.0.0.dev1-py3-none-any.whl
* Now to publish to Test-PyPi just to make sure.
  -- Delete the existing 2.0.0.dev-1
* === OOPS - VSCode does not know of the new .venv. Good time to find out how!!
  Ctrl-Shift-P > Select Interpreter > Alpaca folder > Select the .venv
  That does it.
* Then, remember poetry config --list and turn off the creation of venvs:
    - (.venv) > poetry config virtualenvs.create false
* Complete setting up poetry to publish to Test PyPi
    - (.venv) > poetry config repositories.testpypi https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ (already set)
    - Go onto Test PyPi and get the unique identifier for the March 28 token. I have no idea where I put it so
        3f6ae1fd-e64f-4bb7-99f8-2df0c9ea1a9f
    - (.venv) > poetry config pypi-token.testpypi ...whatever...
    - poetry config --list (the token does not show)
 (.venv) > poetry config --list
    cache-dir = "C:\\Users\\Robert B. Denny\\AppData\\Local\\pypoetry\\Cache"
    experimental.new-installer = true
    installer.parallel = true
    repositories.testpypi.url = "https://test.pypi.org/legacy/"
    virtualenvs.create = false
    virtualenvs.in-project = null
    virtualenvs.path = "{cache-dir}\\virtualenvs"  # C:\Users\Robert B. Denny\AppData\Local\pypoetry\Cache\virtualenvs

* Finally(!!)
  -- poetry  publish -r testpypi -> SHIT that token is wrong. I need to make a new one or find out where in
     hell I put the one from before.
  -- Get new token, save in A-Office Procedures, then reconfigure poetry with that one.
  -- poetry publish -r testpypi -- SHIT!!
        HTTP Error 400: This filename has already been used, use a different version.
        See https://test.pypi.org/help/#file-name-reuse for more information.
        I f'ed up now I can't upload a replacement 2.0.0.dev1 WTF???
  - DAMN IT now I need to build it as dev2. Fix the toml file and documentation.
* HOORAY - It's in TestPyPi *  Test in the Alpyca Test project.
 I installed it to the RPI4 #1 in alpyca-test and it worked. I probably should make a new .venv for it.
 I did do this and it failed for no netifaces. I had to use the full command
    python -m pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple/ alpyca
 This allowed it to find and install the stuff that's not in the test index. OK!!!

15-Jun-2022
-----------
* After the massive Python restoration
  1. poetry build, OK
  2. Get token from the real PyPi, put in A Offfice Procedures
  3. poetry config pypi-token.pypi ...whatever...
  4. poetry publish OK
* Check PyPi, it looks fine.
* Make a fresh PDF on the Windows system. it succeeded.
* Move the repo to ASCOM Iniative
* Update the PDF and upload to ascom-standards/alpyca
* Test on RPI4B #1 - Alpyca Test project. Remove and rebuild the .venv., run the test, OK!!! Only one issue, pylance says that 'from alpaca.telescope' doesn't exist and red squiggles it. It runs OK though. Other packages in the .venv fail in PyLance too. THis has to be the way I set the imterpreter after creating the .venv.
* AH! I went into PyLance settings and added '.venv' as an extra path, and now it finds the import. Actually  that is the ONLY path it should be using. More research.
* I removed that and went into VSCode (on the RPi4B #1)
  + Set Activate Env in Current Terminal
  + Testing: PyTest Enabled (this wasn't set????)
  + Unkown how but the problem seems to have fixed itself. I removed the path from PyLance right?
* Back to the Alpyca project on the RPI - IO added pytest to the .venv for the .venv on the RPI.
  Update PIP -- BUT DO NOT UPDATE OTHERS THEY ARE LOCKED FOR DIST!!!
* Wrapping up. Can't debug tests on RPi, the paths have AlpycaClient in them. DOes jhave them in there though. Pytest --collect-only does not help. Where does it keep those collected tests and paths???
* I DELETED __pycache__ in the PyTest folder of the project. That was it!!
* Had to update tests for fixes in the Omni Simulator.

16-Jun-2022
-----------
* Updated documentation only for Rotator.CanReverse per Rick Burke and Daniel.

xx-Jun-2022
-----------
* See Git commit log for several capitalization and parameter fixed.

17-Jul-2022
-----------
* Rick found that I'm not doing Connection;Keeplive. Yeeks. Switch to using requests.Session() in Device.py.
* Update docs and configs to make 2.0.1rc1 -> poetry build OK -> Make HTML OK, makepdf OK
* Note: https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository
* === PUBLISH 2.0.1-rc1 ===

21-Jul-2022
===========
* Start working on the 2.0.1 production release. Most of this is going to be documentation, all of the TODO items.
* Setting up VSCode and Rinohtype to do Sphinx docs on the Pi.
* DIsabled the LeXStudio reStructuredText extension because of spurious errors on enum_tools.autoenum. There are no problems with this at build time, but the extension wrongly failed to import the package and gave "Problems" errors on multiple .rst files that use the ..autoenum:: directive.
* SEE BELOW FOR SOLUTIONS - DOCS ARE HERE https://docs.restructuredtext.net/#
* Tried the pre-release of LeXStudio reStructuredText extension. Same problems. Removed the extension.
  - Filed GitHub bug report https://github.com/vscode-restructuredtext/vscode-restructuredtext/issues/398
* Actually this led to needing to get all of the sphinx and rinoh pieces into the .venv because the reStructuredText extension depends on the esbonio language server, and that is actually real-time rendering the document at design time! So I had to install the following into the .venv
   - doc8
   - rstcheck
   - restructuredtext-lint
   - rinohtype (0.5.4 fixed)
   - sphinxcontrib-restbuilder
   - sphinx-toobox
* SPHINX UPDATED TO 5.0.2 ALSO
* Tested make html on Windows ... no errors.

22-Jul-2022
-----------
* On Raspberry Pi, many packages had updates including Sphinx. I added the above to the alpyca .venv there.
  NOW on both systems the esbonio server is running as show on the status bar lower right. Hooray!!
* STILL HAVE ERRORS - As soon as I open a .rst file it immediately red-underlines everything apparently it is not liking the CRLF newlines on Windows. Found literal carriage return doc8(D004). To suppress this on Windows, in VSCode Settings
per https://github.com/vscode-restructuredtext/vscode-restructuredtext/issues/84:
    "restructuredtext.linter.doc8.extraArgs": [
        "--ignore D002",
        "--ignore D004"
    ]
* It also says d:\dev\astro\ASCOM Alpaca\Alpyca\.venv\Scripts\python.exe: No module named rstcheck.__main__; 'rstcheck' is a package and cannot be directly executed rstcheck. Looking in the reStructuredText docs undr the Linter article at https://docs.restructuredtext.net/articles/linter.html# I see
    rstcheck 6 is includes too many breaking changes, so it is not supported.
so I rolled rstcheck back to 5.0.0 on both Windows and Linux (even though it looks OK on Linux with 6.0.0-post1). I need to know if reStructuredText is even working at all on Linux (I see syntax highlighting but that is from the other extension). We'll test with autocompletion.
* WELL ... I just went into reStructuredText settings,Restructuredtext › Linter: Disabled Linters and it gave me a droplist from which I selected rstcheck. I'll live without the "enhanced checks" it offers for now.
* Later I attemppted to "fix" rstcheck by re-enabling it, then adding an empty __main__.py to its package folder in the .venv site-packages. Fiddled and gave up.

23-Jul-2022
-----------
* Trying to solve the rstcheck I ran into the issue where shells which `source .venv/bin/activate` do not switch to the virtual environment. Furthermore, as a result DOING SPHINX IN THE SHELL STILL USES THE OLD 4.5 stuff!!
  - Does it ever end? pip install -U sphinx says sphinx-tabs is incompatible, as well as autodocsumm but if I try to upgrade them they uninstall Sphinx 5.0.3 and roll back to sphinx 4.5.0!!!! WHAT CRAP!! Oh well I've been using Sphinx 4.5 OK so let it stay.
* MYSTERY SOLVED IN SHELL - The /bin/activate had the old alpyca-client path in it. This solved several problems. Wow!
* Now to see if I can fix the reStructuredText extension. I found this
     https://docs.restructuredtext.net/articles/development.html#build-from-source
  in one of the issues (researching before filing my #400), and I thought I might give it a whirl. Amazingly I already had Yarn and node installed on RPI 4 #1 due to my code-server hacking in May. so off I go...
  1. yarn install -> two warnings engine vscode appears to be invalid
     warning restructuredtext@190.1.4: The engine "vscode" appears to be invalid
     warning vscode-languageclient@6.1.4 The engine "vscode" appears to be invalid
     (I wonder if this is a result of my code-server hacking in May??)
  2. Got warning to update yarn did it now on 1.22.19
  3. yarn compile
     Got two warnings restructuredtext@190.1.4: The engine "vscode" appears to be invalid
     It succeeded.
  4. code . succeeded and it appears to have started the just built extension!
  5. Its log says it needs doc8, rstcheck, and restructuredtext-lint which I need to add to the global site packages.
  6. Restart code and those problems are gone. One other - "Sphinx" object has no attribute 'add_javascript'. I traced this to the conf.py that is in this project, at the end, to trigger google analytics. Forget it. I commented that shit out.
  7. This is interesting!! He has a test index.rst, a conf.py, everything. I see the error. wow. Now what??: How do I get it to debug?
  8. BOOYAH!!! I found that if you define the path to rstcheck in the extension's settings, it executes it that way. So simply putting 'rstcheck' into the path setting eliminates the problem!!!
* OK, now rstcheck is giving errors on valid hyperlinks like dome-faq in the faq.rst and is referenced in other docs and docstrings. The docs for this cool tool are at https://rstcheck.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
* On WIndows this is still failing to catch errors, on Linux it detects 7 errors: 2 long lines, 5 unreferenced .. _abc: hyperlinks.
* OK ON LINUX 6.0.0-post1 is looking great. It finds the 5 unreferenced links and 2 long lines (giant hyperlinks) inside VSCode and also if invoked on the command line in a shell pointing to the same document.
* Windows??? It seems not to be running. If I execute it against faq.rst it will show errors on the "unreferenced" hyperlinks, but not within VSCode while editing the doc.  Also note that the author says it is unstable on WIndows as shown in https://github.com/rstcheck/rstcheck/issues/107. Maybe it's choking on spaces in the path. I'll look for where to add quotes around the file name on output..... I found the place where the rstcheck error messages are sent to the output (runner.py, line 242) and added double quotes to the document path. Confirmed this by running in the shell and seeing the offending doc path quotes in the error messages. Dang it, it didn't help.
* Went to RPI 4 #3 and DAMN IT, it's nto picking up rstcheck's errors either!!! I made the chnges to the activate, and settings synced to get rstcheck as the path. If I run it from the command line it finds all of the errors, but they don't feed back into reStructuredText. WHat suc ks is that reStructuredText doesn't give any logging output for  shit.

24-Jul-2022
-----------
* Solved the problem on RPi 4 #3 ... the mass transfer of the .venv from #1 to #3 failed to set the 'x' bit on all of the files in .venv/bin and so it was revertring to the global data and pip. Once I did that, I then uninstalled rstcheck and its core, then
  - pip install rstcheck[sphinx] <====
  - Now it is working on RPi 4 #3 HOORAY

22-Aug-2022
-----------
* Time to build 2.0.2. Edit the docs and control files, COMMIT 2.0.2
  + poetry update. check that the latest packages were installed here
  + With new packages, run PyTest suite. Device test needed change for DriverVersion returning string (GitHub Issue #4)
  + poetry build.
  + poetry publish -r testpypi (ok)
  + Over to the test folder and its own .venv
  + pip install -- upgrade -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ Alpyca (installed 2.0.2!)
  + Run the AlpycaTest program to make sure it's there
* Time to actually publish 2.0.2 on PyPi
  + poetry publish (oooooohhhhh boy)  == SHIT! THE README IS FOR THE RC == Sigh, forget it. not worth -> 2.0.3.

=== DEBUGGER ON VSCODE LOOKS OK ===
  - Ran devtest and it works fine
* Tried to preview CHANGES.rst and Esbonio fails to start on the Windows VSCode with
    'd:\dev\astro\ASCOM' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.
  - The Setting for Esbonio › Server: Python Path does not seem to affect this. On a WHIM I reverted to 189.1.0 and it started working.
* Working on 2.0.3, changes to README, CHANGES, docs\conf.py, pyproj.toml, and Focuser.StepSize per GitHub issue #7

02-Jan-2023
-----------
* Time for build 2.0.4
  + Corrections for GitHub Issue #8 (ID -> Id in Switch) and test_device -> 0.3 version for Omni Sim
  + Above done on Linux, synced with Win, the following done with VSCode on Win.
  + Passes all tests with OmniSim 0.3
  + Poetry update to get the latest packages
  + Again passes pyTest tests
  + Run Poetry Update on Linux. Now I have a Poetry-modified Poetry.Lock on both. Committed and Git did a branch merge. Cool.
  + poetry build
  + poetry publish -r testpypi (ok)
  + Over to AlpycaTest project, confirm that 2.0.4 is installed with pip and Pip Manager.pip
* Reviewed README and found updates needed. Lesson learned above. I changed these, then
  + poetry build
  + poetry publish (er.......)

===== BREAK =====
* Now I can no longer make either HTML nor PDF with Sphinx. Somehow the Poetry Update installed some shit that broke Sphinx. Now I am here:

* SO this is rinoh. I temporarily commented out 'rinoh.frontend.sphinx' in the Sphinx conf.py. Now I can build the HTML at least.
* !! FOUND DANIEL LINKS !! in docs and readme. FIx these (omni sim)
* Now to find out what broke rinoh.
  + Go to https://github.com/brechtm/rinohtype/issues, do not see this one. Start a new one.
  + Advises to install latest via pip install https://github.com/brechtm/rinohtype/archive/refs/heads/master.zip which succeeded and
    installed rinohtype 0.5.5 and god knows what else.  Then uncommented rinhh.frontend.sphinx in conf.py but still have the same
    error. Also makepdf fails the same way.
  + Create new issue on his GitHub. https://github.com/brechtm/rinohtype/issues/389
  + Discovered that by deactivating to global site packages I can build PDF!!!! This-five-sucks.
* Deactivated the venv, rinoh works! After fixing conf.py to enable the plugin and settings, it builds!!
  + Copied this to the ASCOM site along with the HTML

04-Feb-2023
-----------
* By deactivating the venv here, I can build html even with the 'rinoh.frontend.sphinx' in extensions.
* BOOYAH! I can also build PDF here on W7 in the global site packages. Now let's use pip list to show the versions of the bits.
  The interesting this is that the SystemLog says that the global site packages have been updated. It's weird I thought I
  had stripped old venv and built a new one......
* Build a new .venvdocs for Alpyca on W7 with the recipe. Selrct the .venvdocs, validate that Pip Manager is looking at
  it, then add the following with Pip Manager:
  + sphinx -> 5.3.0 (due to Pyton 3.7 here on W7) tons of stuff
  + sphinxcontrib_restbuilder -> 0.3
  + sphinx_rtd_theme -> 1.1.1
  + rinohtype -> 0.5.4
  + enum-tools -> 0.9.0.post1
  + sphinx_toolbox (req'd by enum_tools.autoenum) -> 3.4.0
  + Failed on netifaces and dateutil, so need these
    - netifaces -> 0.11.0
    - python-dateutil -> 2.8.2
  + At this point can successfully build HTML Alpyca docs WITHOUT RINOH EXTENSION.
  + With rinoh extension, Can't instantiate abstract class DynamicRinohDistribution with abstract methods locate_file, read_text
  + Back rev docutils, sphinx_autodoc_typehints, sphinx-toolbox to versions in global site-packges. No luck, still fails.
  + The rinoh/resource.py is untouched yet it works so this is no longer the issue.
  + Spelunking in the code for rinoh/resource in the area of that DynamicRinoh, I noticed that it uses importlib. In the .venvdocs
    importlib-metadata is at 6.0.0, yet in the successful global packages, it is 4.11.3. On a wild hair whim, I downgraded that,
    and BOOYAH!! I can make HTML and PDF!
* Downgraded importlib-metadata to 4.11.3 in the global site packages for all of the systems. on the W10 system it says that
  keyring 23.13.1 requires at least importlib-metadata 4.11.4. I tried that one and it's OK with Rinoh as well!.So let'safe
  make it 4.11.4 everywhere.
* THIS IS SO STUPID ON MY PART -- THE GITHUB ISSUE SAYS IT RIGHT THERE. I didn't know what they meant by importlib-metadata. DUH!!

========================== 2 0 2 4 ===========================

27-Feb-2024
-----------
* Refreshing on Alpyca (client package). Looking OK on the W7 system with the '.venv':poetry VE. On RPi #1 loads of VSCode
  updating extensions. **W10 IS RAW COPY OF W7 DISK** NEEDS NEW VENV ETC.
* PyTest on RPi #1 is running!!!

29-Feb-2024
-----------
* Getting this going on the W10 system
  --------------------------------------------------
* POETRY DOCS ARE AT https://python-poetry.org/docs/
  --------------------------------------------------
* Blow away the .venv from the W7 system that came from disk copying D:\
* Make a new venv python -m venv .venv, tell VSCode to use it. OK.
* Using Pip Manager VSCODE, update pip and setuptools
* Get Alpyca environment running onm W10. Needs poetry. New scheme from
  https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installing-with-the-official-installer
  installs poetry globally and with its own venv, then to get started you need
  Poetry's bin directory (C:\Users\rdenn\AppData\Roaming\Python\Scripts)
  in your `PATH` environment variable. Using the W10 environment editor, I
  added the path to my env vars, not the system ones. Log out-in. OK.
  poetry --version works
* Now to load up the new virgin.venv for this project with the stuff I need. This project has already been initialized
  by Poetry (in the past on the W7 system) so there are already a pyproject.py and poetry.lock files.
========================================================
  CREATE BRANCH 'platform7' AND PUBLISH. SWITCH TO THIS.
========================================================
  + I want to update all of the dependencies. From poetry Basic Usage (scroll to end) I can either use 'poetry update'
    or just delete poetry.lock and do the poetry install using the packages in pyproject.toml. I decided to do the
    'poetry update' method, which succeeded. Hooray!
  + AMAZING, it did not change pyproject.toml, but poetry.lock is not full of latest versions. COOL!
* Using poetry install PyTest and Sphinx. See "Dependency Groups" in the Poetry docs. I want to do exactly that, have
  dependencies for testing, and for documentation. Note that the existring pyproject.toml has a dependency Groups
  [tool.poetry.dev-dependencies] and per the docs this should be migrated to group dotted notation
  [tool.poetry.group.dev.dependencies] for a 'dev' group. I am going to add 'test' and 'docs' groups.
  + The 'poetry update' above installed pytest and pytz from [tool.poetry.dev-dependencies] and put them into poetry.lock.
    I hand edited the pyproject.toml to put pytest and pytz into [tool.poetry.group.test.dependencies]
* Now to update the test packages per pip's latest version:
  + Pytest 7.4.4 -> 8.0.2
  + pytz 2022.7.1 -> 2024.1
* Try to run PyTest!! Looking good, I see stuff that needs to be changed for Platform 7, but the Device and Focuser
  tests now pass with the 0.4 Omni Simulator.
* Switch to Daniel's /simulator/ setttings endpoints. See conftest.py.

01-Mar-2024
-----------
* Got reading XML from the /simulator endpoints working, with some baroque Python.
* Converting to native Python was broken for Boolean, I was living on borrowed time!! Fixed.

03-Mar-2024
-----------
* All tests pass on W10 system with latest (March 2) 0.4 omni sim, with 3 caveats in Telescope
  + Settings XML uses CanSetPointingState for Property CanSetPierSide. Commented out because, even though the OmniSim
    "Set Side of Pier" checkbox is set, Property CanSetPierSide  is always False.
  + GuideRateRightAscension and GuideRateDeclination can succefully be written to, however the value coming back
    is always 0.00417807...

05-Mar-2024
-----------
* Start of changes for Platform 7 per https://ascom-standards.org/newdocs/relnotes.html. New
  OperationCancelledException, async additions to device common members, async
  additions to CoverCalibrator and Switch. HTML DOCS ARE BUILDING!

08-Mar-2024
-----------
* PyTest new members for Platform 7. New Connect()/Disconnect()/Connecting replaces property-write
  Connected. OK.
* New CalibratorChanging and CoverMoving properties replace brightness and cover state checks
  for completion. OK.
* Looking for print() statement outputs from the tests. Needed to change [tool.pytest.ini_options]
  in pyproject.toml addopts = "--setupshow -rA" (the capital 'A' for all, 'a' for all except success).
  Note that some PyTest references don't list 'setupshow' which traces fixture usages. A must!
* TADA! All of the unit tests pass with the OmniSim 0.4.0-alpha01+e33cd8e7d7b17e46126799230fba409e2568a4
  version.

18-Jun-2024
-----------
*  W10 now bitching about "set pytest path" ... running with current .venv. The workspace is not being
   GIT synced so this did not get zapped. F**K.
   - I put in a pytest path in the workspace file and it seems to work!! 6 tests passed but there is a
     Discovery Error after SafetyMonitor though. OH Refresh Tests and they are all there!!
     *** ALL TESTS PASS *** Hooray!
* Esbonio wrestling. More bits needed to go inn with PIP. Then after restart a new esbonio went in.
  I did not try to build docs. Laterz and I need to zero back in on poetry.

14-Sep-2024
-----------
* Well now Unittest Discovery Error. So DAMN fragile!!!!!!!!!!!!! I had to re-configure it for
  PyTest and test_*.py, then re-start and now it has disacovered the tests. Sheesh.
* Great! Pass all tests with OmniSim 0.4.0-rc01+481bc7b080d10737ad96e9735ed5b4eb0949f415
* Referring back to 29-Feb for poetry. First update the dependencies needed (see tool.poetry.dependencies)
  - Use pipmanager to update requests, netifaces, python-dateutil, typing-extensions, enum-tools.
  - Poetry update...
    - Updating certifi (2024.2.2 -> 2024.8.30)
    - Updating idna (3.6 -> 3.9)
    - Updating packaging (23.2 -> 24.0)
    - Downgrading pluggy (1.4.0 -> 1.2.0)
    - Downgrading typing-extensions (4.12.2 -> 4.7.1)
    - Downgrading enum-tools (0.12.0 -> 0.9.0.post1)
    - Downgrading pytest (8.0.2 -> 7.4.4)
    - Downgrading pytz (2024.1 -> 2022.7.1)
    - Downgrading requests (2.32.3 -> 2.31.0)
  - **WHY** Oh wow -- These are dependencies in the tree that have a max value! Anyway we're good now.
* Tests complete again. Need OmniSim before opening test section.
* Checkpoint commit / sync (7011925)

16-Sep-2024
-----------
* Back to preparing Alpyca 3.0.0, Tweak the docs including README.
* Using the W10 system now. My steps above for 02-Jan-2023. Repeat here:
  + poetry build
  + poetry publish -r testpypi -- failed -- "Repository testpypi is not defined" - From above (06-May-2022)
    1. (venv) > poetry config repositories.testpypi https://test.pypi.org/legacy/
    2. (venv) > poetry config pypi-token.testpypi ...whatever...
  + poetry publish -r testpypi -- failed --
    - Uploading alpyca-3.0.0-py3-none-any.whl FAILED
      HTTP Error 403: Invalid or non-existent authentication information. See https://test.pypi.org/help/#invalid-auth for more information.
    - (eventually) Make a new token damn it. "alpyca3"
      poetry config pypi-token.testpypi ...whatever...
      poetry publish -r testpypi ... OK!
      Saved new token on Documents A-Office-Procedures PyPi folder and also Dropbox/crypted and KeePass
    - Make a new token for PyPi as well
      poetry config pypi-token ...whatever...
      Saved new token on Documents A-Office-Procedures PyPi folder and also Dropbox/crypted and KeePass
  + Over to AlpycaTest project, confirm that 2.0.4 is installed with pip and Pip Manager.pip
    - Create new .venv3 to simulate fresh insatll and validate dependencies
    - python -m pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple/ alpyca
      Looks good alpyca 3.0.0 and only its dependencies shows.
    - Run test program with OmniSim -- OK!!
      Change to use new Connect()/Disconnect()
    - Test with the sample from the docs. OK!!
  + Make final tweaks to README
  + Poetry build to capture that
=== READY FOR POETRY PUBLISH ===

07-Oct-2024  ** PUBLISHED **
-----------
* Merge platform 7 branch with master. In VSCode, switch to Master. Then Merge platform 7.
  - delete a sad story of Git jibberish. Caused by presence of 4 Thunder Test Cnfiguration files on Master.
  - Dump the entire local Alpyca folder and restore from overnight backup, followed by a cleanup of those
    files and a second merge attempt, which worked including the push to remote.
* Updated the Git remote which was old - pointing to the repo from last year!! Why did anything work ha ha?
* Publish to rel PyPi -- Invalid auth!!
  - poetry config pypi-token.pypi ... whatever ... -> OK
  -----------------------------------------
  - poetry publish -> OK! Shows on PyPi OK.

    make: *** [Makefile:20: rinoh] Error 2
  - Same exact error. Not a single hint about possible document content (or context) that would cause this.
  - Tried deleting the doctrees and rinoh folders in build, didn't help.
    ** NEVER MIND THE PDF ** I'm not going to waste my time on this one right now. I'll wait till someone actually cares and tries to get the PDF then tackle it then.

10-Oct-2024
-----------
* This PDF error is probably a result of some trash in my RST. Let's try to find it by isolation.
  - Removing alpacaclasses from index, and it builds
  - By process of elimination in alpacaclasses, it's in alpaca.telescope.rst.
  - Furthermore it's in
    .. module:: alpaca.telescope
    .. autoclass:: Telescope
        :members:
        :inherited-members:
    Damn it. Now I gotta look at the generated stuff in HTML Telescope Classes for a botch.
    I found some RST errors but no luck getting it to build.
    It's in the comments stuff in telescope.py right? Autoclass makes the RST and that chokes rinoh.
* Re-publish the fixes to the docs. No logic changes so no update to the alpyca package 3.0.0.

11-Oct-2024
-----------
* Locate the offending docstrings in telescope.py that prevent PDF building. By successive approximation it came down to this bit of docstring
        .. admonition:: Master Interfaces Reference
            :class: green

            |DestinationSideOfPier|

            .. |DestinationSideOfPier| raw:: html

                <a href="https://ascom-standards.org/newdocs/telescope.html#Telescope.DestinationSideOfPier" target="_blank">
                Telescope.DestinationSideOfPier()</a> (external)
    """
  - It renders perfectly in HTML\
* Actually after several more hours and countless trials, I determined that the class name "DestinationSideOfPier" itself causes the process to become unstable and die. So what to do?

* OHHHHHH ... Those Master Interfaces References with the external links |xxx| are not even rendered by Rinoh. Each one really needs to be coded with .. only:: html and .. only:: rinoh.  **UGLY RIGHT NOW **
* Final docstring syntax for Master Interfaces, e.g.
        .. admonition:: Master Interfaces Reference
            :class: green

            .. only:: html

                |CanMoveAxis|

                .. |CanMoveAxis| raw:: html

                    <a href="https://ascom-standards.org/newdocs/telescope.html#Telescope.CanMoveAxis" target="_blank">
                    Telescope.CanMoveAxis()</a> (external)

            .. only:: rinoh

                `Telescope.CanMoveAxis() <https://ascom-standards.org/newdocs/telescope.html#Telescope.CanMoveAxis>`_

      """
  - This works fine. Now... what a pain to make these changes throughout!!!
* Still DestinationSideOfPier blows Rinoh out of the  water.
* DECISION FOR NOW -- NO PDF DOCUMENT. I TRIED AND WAS WILLING TO PUT IN A LOAD OF WORK, BUT ONE DAMN INTERFACE MEMBER BLOWS UP! WTF? MAYBE LATER I'LL
* Oh wait... reviewing the error:
    Exception occurred:
      File "C:\Users\rdenn\AppData\Roaming\Python\Python311\site-packages\rinoh\flowable.py", line 297, in flow_inner
        assert container.advance2(padding_border_bottom)
    AssertionError
  I wonder if a Rinoh style sheet could solve this. I think I'll file an issue on his GitHub repo.
  RINOH ISSUE: https://github.com/brechtm/rinohtype/issues/435
* Meanwhile, review the Rinoh style and control files alpyca.rts and alpyca.rtt while reviewing the 0.55 Rinoh Manual.
* Looked for the style log, https://www.mos6581.org/rinohtype/master/elementstyling.html but Alpyca's build process doesn't produce one. AlpycaDevice's one does!!! I can't see how to change this and the doc says nothing about this being an option.
* FOUND STYLE SHEETS AND TEMPLATES DEFAULTS
  Templates: C\Users\rdenn\AppData\Roaming\Python\Python311\site-packages\rinoh\templates (I use book)
  Style Sheets: C:\Users\rdenn\AppData\Roaming\Python\Python311\site-packages\rinoh\data\stylesheets (I use sphinx)
* I grabbed sphinx.rts and it is in References

12-Oct-2024
-----------
* Well I tried again today with DestinationSideOfPier having .. only:: html for Master Interfaces Reference and the PDF built. SO my next task is to fix all of the Master Interfaces Reference sections with ..only:: html and also the .. only:: rinoh section as above.
* Then I decided to tackle this:
      PT Serif does not include a normal medium upright font. Falling back to normal regular upright
      PTSerif-Regular does not contain glyph for unicode index 0x2192 (→)age 7
  - Tried to change serif_typeface (in alpyca.rts Rinoh stylesheet) to DejaVu Serif, and I got the assert on padding_border_bottom! but at a much earlier page. Woah. I'm on the trail now.
  - Commented out the serif_typeface in the stylesheet. It uses TeX Gyre Pagella by default. And... it hits the padding_border-bottom error very early!!
  - Looks like I want to learn to read a style log. I've apparently been incredibly lucky with PT Serif.
  - Looking at the style logs they are **identical** for either the successful run with PT Serif and for the fast fail using default TeX Gyre Pagella. The font names do not appear in the style log!!
  - Playing with the  style sheet starting with the lucky good settings, change font_size to 12, BOOM.
  - Leave that and comment out the line_spacing, BOOM
  - Back to 11 font_size leave line_spacing commented out,
  - Now change line_spacing=fixed(14pt,leading(0))  (12 -> 14 pt) OK
  - Now font_size=12, line_spacing=16, serif_typeface=PT Serif this rendered OK, but with these warnings:
      Tab did not fall into any of the tab stops. (page 343):15 (01:38) page 343
      Tab did not fall into any of the tab stops. (page 345):09 (01:38) page 345
      Tab did not fall into any of the tab stops. (page 347):04 (01:39) page 347
      Tab did not fall into any of the tab stops. (page 349):00 (01:39) page 349
    and this is GIGANTIC!! Ugly!!
  - Back to font_size=10, line_spacing=12, serif_typeface=Merriweather (for the other warnings). Well same BS Merriweather does not include a normal medium upright font. Falling back to normal regular upright. It downloaded Merriweather though. BOOM
  - Increase line_spacing to 14, BOOM immediately.
  - Eliminate line_spacing BOOM
  - Back to first principles, eliminate font_size, serif_face, and line_spacing. OK but UGLY
  - Try Merriweather only - BOOM
  - Try PT Serif and no font_size or line_spacing BOOM WHAT THE HELL???
  - PT Serif and font_size=11 or line_spacing=14, this should be OK as it was above. Man this stuff is FRAGILE!!
      Tab did not fall into any of the tab stops. (page 209):07 (01:31) page 209
      Tab did not fall into any of the tab stops. (page 211):00 (01:31) page 211
    This rendered OK.
  - Just change font to Merriweather, BOOM. What the hell??? Apparently I have been incredibly plcky for having chosen PT Serif.
  - OK, let's see if the stuff in DestinationSideOfPier renders with no font_size, serif_face, or line_spacing. OK!!
  - Now add in the ..only:: rinoh link for the PDF, OK!!! Let's check it. OK!! I don't like the serif used.
  - Now change the serif font to Roboto (sans serif). Will it build?  YES!!
  - Add space-above=2pt and space_below=2pt to [paragraph] other stuff commented out. BOOM fails. Always padding_border_bottom as usual.
  - Looking at the default sphinx stylesheet, guessing [body] space_below=5pt (0->5). BOOM
  - Forget all of that, just change the object signature color to be less blue. That looks OK.
* GIVEN THE GOOFY FORMATTING AND FAQ CROSS REFERENCE TITLES, AND OTHER STUFF, IS THIS WORTH IT?
  WELL, YES

13-Oct-2024
-----------
* Good morning! I changed the serif-typeface to Roboto (sans serif) and commented out all of the [default: Paragraph] settings, The document renders with the html and rinoh sections OK. It even renders without the "failed to converge" process. This looks good.
* Now to tackle the spacing ugliness in DriverException. Cannot wrap source, must be all on one line. Autodoc requirement for PDF. Still OK for html.
* ** SUCCESS ** Both HTML and PDF look good though I would like the 11 pt font for PDF. Too bad. Too fragile.
* Now to fix up the DriverException sections, and the html-vs-rinoh sections for Master Interfaces Reference.
* Also there are cross references to FAQs that show in PDF as section numbers instead of their titles. Look at the Note: at the beginning of the Camera Class for example. It should read See the "Example: Acquiring an Image, Creating FITS Image below" (and it does in HTML) but in PDF it reads "See the Section 3.1.3 below". Now what??
  - Maybe this is configurable in the template? I grabbed the book template from, C\Users\rdenn\AppData\Roaming\Python\Python311\site-packages\rinoh\templates and put it into References. Looking at it I think the processing of references is in C:\Users\rdenn\AppData\Roaming\Python\Python311\site-packages\rinoh\reference.py. There is shows that a reference is supposed to be the section number. I want the section and title or just the title. Now how to make it happen???
  RINOH ISSUE: https://github.com/brechtm/rinohtype/issues/437
  WORST CASE: Use :ref:`Link title <label name>` format which I should be able to do with global search and destroy.
  NOPE! Rinoh ignores the explicit title and still renders to the section number :-(. Added to the issue. Is there any other workaround?
* OK Fix the DriverException description excess word spacing for PDF by putting it on one line. Use Replace in Files on all device .py.
  - LOSER!! Caused Rinoh crash, the usual padding_border_bottom error. THIS IS SO DELICATE!!!!!
  - Try again in filterwheel. OK
  - Do each device one at a time. Start with Camera and do each .PY file one at a time. Actually do global search/replace then uncomment a class at a time in alpacaclasses. Camera and CoverCalibrator are OK. Dome died. Skipping that, filterwheel OK. Add focuser, OK. Add ObservingConditions, OK. Add Rotator OK.
* For the cross references by number instead of title, I got a reply from Brett to put a magic incantation into the alpyca.rts stylesheet. It worked!!
* Now back to chasing the botch in the unwrapping of DriverException. Add SafetyMonitor OK. Add switch. OK. Add Telescope, WOW OK!! Add device, OK!!! So... only Dome dies??? WTF? Replace dome...IT RENDERED!! Well what the hell??? Oh well, I'll take it. I zapped the Build folder contents beforehand.
=========== HTML ONLINE UPDATED WITH THESE CHANGES ===========
- switch to .venv -
=========== RAN UNIT TESTS TO MAKE SURE I DIDN'T SCORCH THE CODE ===========
- switch back to P11 global -
* Now for the Master Interfaces boxes.
  - Start with telescope and do just the first three. Does it render? Yes. so press on and to the whole Telescope.
  - Thru Telescope.CanSetRightAscensionRate ...OK!! Got to CanUnpark, OK!!
  - Thru SiderealTime -- OK!!

14-Oct-2024
-----------
* Onward with the Master Interfaces boxes. Through AxisRates()... hanging in there!! Through SlewToAltAzAsync() looking good. I may get lucky. Telescope completed!! WOOHOO.
* OK, I got sick of this copy paste stuff and decided to take a wild stab at the crashes.
    File "C:\Users\rdenn\AppData\Roaming\Python\Python311\site-packages\rinoh\flowable.py", line 297, in flow_inner
      assert container.advance2(padding_border_bottom)
  - I commented out the assert statement to see what happens even though the asserted condition is not met. So I uncommented the font_size= and line_spacing= in the alpyca.rts style sheet and ran it. It renders!! However, inspection of the PDF shows that the blocks of code formed by simply indenting text (the installation commands and the sample program in introduction.py) have zero padding at the bottom! They look bad. This is with the font_size of 11. Still bad at default 10pt. Well I can't find anything else that's messed up.
  - Experimentation has shown that the code blocks formed by indenting text (samples etc) are indeed treated by rinoh as [code block].
  - I set the [code block] padding_bottom and nothing changed. Same with space_below (reading from the default sphinx.rts stylesheet for parameter names).
  - I can't believe how much better the PDF looks with font_size=11 and line_spacing=fixed(14pt,leading(0)). Would crash rinoh 100% before I commented out that assert.
  - So now I need to learn how to read the style log for [code block]
  - OOHHH Engine a line with :: then indenting lines below creates a code-block!!! Used in introduction.py. See https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html#rst-literal-blocks and also see the Sphinx Help "Showing Code Examples". Man it's been a long time but it's coming back!! Pygments does the highlighting. Default is for Python.  I'm not going to sweat the small stuff for PDF!!!
  - Trying to work on the style sheet. Make tye admonitions have titles on separate line. Again looking at sphinx.rtsm, well [admonition title] keep-with-next=false doesn't do it. I guess that relates to the individual words.
  - SUCCESS:
      [builtin admonition:Admonition]
      inline_title=false
* OHHHHH ALL OF THE IN-DOC LINKS TO OTHER MEMBERS ACT LIKE LINKS ON HOVER BUT INOP!! This is so bad.
  - On a whim I tried to remove the :py prefix from :attr: and :meth: and the links WORK!!!!!!!! WOOHOO!!
    *************
    WHAT A RELIEF
    *************
    NOTE: :py:class: works in PDF already

17-Oct-2024
-----------
* Back to  the Master Interfaces links for PDF. Telescope is done. Next Camera...ugh

07-Nov-2024
-----------
* Master Interfaces links for PDF. Completed Camera.

23-Nov-2024
-----------
* Finally other classes completed over last few weeks. Stray 'T' in text cost me half a day ha ha.
* Also did the .rst class container docs for PDF vs HTML. Geeze.
* Changed all Notes: headings to Note: so would render into colored boxes in PDF.
* Adjust the PDF stylesheet to make the admonition boxes all bordered with padding and separated titles.
* Trying to get the Master Interfaces References admonition box to render green. I GOT IT.

20-Feb-2025
-----------
* ALERT: For the PyTest tests to work, you must be on the virtual environment .venv.
* Create Develop branch and change to That

21-Feb-2025
-----------
* Clone alpyca onto RPi 5. Install required packages requests: netifaces, python-dateutil, pytz (some for PyTest or dev snippets)
* Try PyTest, Linux-OmniSim 0.4 does not return full info on xmlprofile endpoint, only uniquid. I must not have the latest OmniSim for Linux-aarch64.
  - Windows one 0.4.1-rc.1+309d2a70c9d9b053654b9e6a0dc3d027ec928936 64bit returns complete xmlprofile.
  - Cannot run PyTest till I get latest OmniSim for RPi 64.
* Make a copy of my (untracked) test snippets file devtest.py and also the demo from docs as QuickTest.py.

22-Feb-2025
-----------
* PyTest fixtures in conftest.py - Make OmniSim address symbolic, and use the 0.4.1 OmniSim on Windows.
* ALL PYTESTS PASS on Pi5 and also W10 systems.

23-Feb-2025
-----------
* Implementing async Connect()/Disconnect()/Connecting for pre-Platform 7 devices, per
  https://ascomtalk.groups.io/g/ASCOMCoreTeam/topic/adding_simulated_connect_to/111235515
  and using as a model
  https://github.com/ASCOMInitiative/ASCOMPlatform/blob/main/ASCOM.DriverAccess/AscomDriver.cs
  which catched exceptions on Connected = True and throws on the next Connecting Read.
* Concerns (this addition is for low-skill programmers)
  - What if programmer loops 'while not connectED' or something? Reading Connected while async
    Connected = True is in progress?
  - Should Connect() instantly return if reading Connected returns True? Throw right there
    if device returns an exception?
  - Cache Connected for subsequent skipping of Connect() only not if client wants the real state.
* Looks good except exception handling still needs testing
* ALERT - DO DOCS OUTSIDE OF VENV ON W10
* HTML builds fine on Program Files\Python311
* PDF builds fine on Program Files\Python311 also -- WOOHOO
* Add checks in Camera unit tests for setting OmniSim Defaults on Camera.

25-Feb-2025
-----------
* Implement rigorous Exceptions unit test test_exceptions -- PASSED
* Remove old bypass for Telescope unit test OmniSim CamSetPierside being stuck at False
* Remove old bypass for Telescope unit test for SlewSettleTime stuck at 0
* Remove old bypass for Telescope unit test for GuideRateRightAscension stuck
  + GuideRateDeclination still broken filed OmniSim Issue #16
* With the above, ALL PYTESTS PASS

26-Feb-2025
-----------
* Tests of replacements for netifaces 0.11.0 by making temporary .venvs with netifaces2 and
  netifaces-plus.
  - netifaces2 failed compatibility, the dicts of IP addresses do not have 'broadcast'
    elements plus I see differences in its attributes and properties in the debugger.
  - netifaces-plus, the subject of Issue #17 looks identical!! Awaiting confirmation from the
    submitter that it installs as pip install netifaces-plus on W11 Python13. If so I'm going
    with it.
* DECISION: GO  TO PYTHON 3.9 (No more Win7, Older RPi Bulldog OK)
* Reviewing Poetry operations before changing the netifaces -> netifaces-plus. Back to 14-Sep-2024.
  - Change Python version to > 3.9
  - Update dependencies for Alpyca in [tool.poetry.dependencies]
  - Re run the Unit tests to make sure they work with the new dependencies -- ALL PASS
* Poetry Update
  - Updating certifi (2024.8.30 -> 2025.1.31)
  - Updating charset-normalizer (3.3.2 -> 3.4.1)
  - Updating idna (3.9 -> 3.10)
  - Updating packaging (24.0 -> 24.2)
  - Updating pluggy (1.2.0 -> 1.5.0)
  - Updating pygments (2.17.2 -> 2.19.1)
  - Updating six (1.16.0 -> 1.17.0)
  - Updating urllib3 (2.0.7 -> 2.3.0)
  - Downgrading enum-tools (0.12.0 -> 0.9.0.post1)
  - Created new poetry.lock of course. And these are for Python >3.9.
  - Tests complete again. OK.
* Checkpoint Commit (7bfc30f) * More documentation, tweak CHANGES and README for
  updated sample showing new exception handling

27-Feb-2025
-----------
* Switching to netifaces-plus with great care.
  - Poetry update -> No dependencies to install or update
  - In pyproject.toml [tool.poetry.dependencies] remove netifaces and add
    netifaces-plus = "^0.12.4"
  - Poetry update
      - Removing netifaces (0.11.0)
      - Installing netifaces-plus (0.12.4)
    (updated the virtual environment and the poetry.lock, perfect)
  - Discovery test 'disctest' completes OK. *NOTE* More tests needed!!
* Update versions in pyproject.toml to force newer versions. Check for downgrading/
  - Poetry update
     - Updating enum-tools (0.9.0.post1 -> 0.12.0)
    Perfect. All set for build/publish.
* ---------- OHHHHHHH ------------
  I just found this on GitHub looking at netifaces-plus issue #6
  https://github.com/tsukumijima/netifaces-plus/issues/6#issuecomment-2429078149
  He's abandoning this too!!!
  > SUGGEST MOVING TO 'ifaddr' WHICH IS ALL PYTHON. Oh boy this could be tricky.
  Guess what: In the PyPi listing https://pypi.org/project/ifaddr/
    it says s of ifaddr 0.2.0 we implement the equivalent of netifaces.interfaces().
    It’s available through ifaddr.netifaces.interfaces().
    WTH? Let's give this a whirl!!
    NOPE on ifaddr.netifaces.interfaces() it just gives us the GUID of the interface
       as a string. Continue with ifaddr and whatever else we can find
* Progress. It seems to be working on IPv4!! IPv6 not working. I lost track of what
  is going wrong after shooting in the dark in several directions. TOMORROW!!

01-Mar-2025
-----------
* Lots of work and tail chasing on Discovery. Then I made a mess of the Git repo while
  flipping back and forth between 2 RPis and my W10 system. It appears my old W7 system
  is not receiving the IPv6 broadcasts, but it's fine on IPV4. At present IPV4 appears
  good on Linux and on W10 with ifaddr. Some slime to skip probable dead interfaces
  on IPv4 but it looks OK.

06-Mar-2025
-----------
* Work on IPV6 and it's looking good. The problem with the W7 system was a ghost. It's
  OK. Now tested on Linux and Windows, sees 3 servers (OmniSim) running on W10, W7, and
  RPi. Ready to switch over and get field test. Replace discovery.py with new code in
  discovery2.py, remove discovery2.py and disc2test.py. Remove netifaces-plus and psutil
  from the .venv. Remove disc2test from launch.json. Sync repo on W10 and Linux.

07-Mar-2025
-----------
* Update Poetry data
  - Remove netifaces-plus
  - Add ifaddr
  - Poetry Update ... no changes.
