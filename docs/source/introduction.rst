Introduction and Quick Start
============================
This package provides access to ASCOM compatible astronomy devices via the Alpaca network protocol. 
For more information see the |ascsite|, specifically the |devhelp| section, and the |apiref|.

Member capitalization
---------------------
This help file provides detailed descripions of the ASCOM Interfaces for all supported device types.
Note that, rather than follow :pep:`8`, the method and property names, as well as enumerations 
and exceptions, all follow the capitalization that has historically been assigned to ASCOM
interface members. The Class and member descriptions, notes, and exceptions raised all 
follow the universal ASCOM standards established long ago.

Common Misconceptions and Confusions
------------------------------------
Throughout the evolution of ASCOM, and particularly recently with Alpaca, our goal has been to
provide a strong framework for reliability and integrity. We see newcomers to programming 
looking for help on the |supforum|. There are a few subject areas within which misconceptions
and confusion are common. Before starting an application development project with Alpyca Client,
you may benefit from reviewing the following design principles that are *foundational*:
