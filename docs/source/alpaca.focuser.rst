Focuser Class
=============
.. admonition:: Master Interfaces Reference
    :class: green

    These green boxes in each interface member each have a link to the
    corresponding member definition in the |master|. The information in this
    Alpyca document is provided *for your convenience*. If there is any question,
    the info in |master| is the official specification.

.. the |master| link is in device.py and thus is accessible to all of the device
   specific document contexts.
